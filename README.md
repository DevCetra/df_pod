## Summary

This package provides tools for managing app state using ValueNotifier-like objects called Pods (an acronym for "Points of Data"). For a practical demonstration of how Pods work in conjunction with [GetIt](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) for state management, refer to [this example](https://pub.dev/packages/df_pod/example). For a full feature set, please refer to the [API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/df_pod/).

## Quickstart

```dart
// Define a Pod, similar to how you would define a ValueNotifier.
final pNumbers = Pod<List<int>>([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

// Use the Pod in your UI, similar to a ValueListenableBuilder.
PodBuilder(
  pod: pNumbers,
  builder: (context, numbers, child) {
    return Text('Count: ${numbers.length}');
  },
);

// Set a Pod with the set function. This will trigger PodBuilder to rebuild.
pNumbers.set([1, 2, 4]);

// Update a pod with the update function. This will also trigger PodBuilder to rebuild.
pNumbers.update((e) => e..add(5));

// Dispose of Pods when they are no longer needed.
pNumbers.dispose();

// If the Pod<T> type T is a primitive type or implements an Equatable, the PodBuilder will only rebuild if the Pod's value actually changed.
final pHelloWorld = Pod('Hello World');
pHelloWorld.set('Hello World'); // this will not trigger a rebuild, as String is a primitive, pass-by-value type.

// A Pod can be transformed into a ChildPod using the map function.
final pLength = pNumbers.map((e) => e!.length);
final ChildPod<List<int>, int> pSum = pNumbers.map((e) => e!.reduce((a, b) => a + b));

// A ChildPod can be further mapped into another ChildPod.
final pInverseLength = pLength.map((e) => 1 / e!);

// ChildPods don't need to be manually disposed; they are disposed automatically when their parent is disposed.
pInverseLength.dispose(); // This will print a warning!

// You can use multiple Pods with a PodListBuilder.
PodListBuilder(
  podList: [pLength, pSum],
  builder: (context, values, child) {
    final [length, sum] = values.toList();
    return Text('Length is $length and sum is $sum');
  },
);

// Pods can also be reduced into a single, ChildPod:
final pZero = pLength.reduce(pInverseLength, (p1, p2) => p1.value * p2.value); // pZero will be disposed if either pLength or pInverseLength is disposed.
```
